                <p>I have previously worked with Mridul and I definitely recommend his services. Mridul is easy-going,
                    and finishes his job promptly. He gives good suggestions on what can be improved or added to the
                    project to enhance its capability. Not to mention, the support offered after the job has been
                    completed is undoubtedly the best I have experienced.</p>

                <p>I had a great experience working with Mridul! His positive attitude and excellent communication
                    skills made the project a success. He completed the assigned tasks well, and I was impressed by his
                    willingness to learn and develop his skills in Hugo. While he may benefit from further practice and
                    development before taking on a larger project lead role, this just goes to show his humility and
                    dedication to improving. I appreciate his work and look forward to working with him again in the
                    future!</p>

                <p>Mirdul helped us with a project for our HUGO template that is used on our blog. His overall quality
                    of work and speed of delivery was immaculate. Smaller changes were implemented according to our
                    briefing in no time. We would definitely hire Mirdul again and would recommend him to anyone valuing
                    high quality work in all aspects and a great line of communication throughout the project.</p>

                    <p>
                    <p>
                        I joined <strong>99acres</strong> as a senior software engineer and immediately tackled a
                        challenging project, developing a dynamic auto-description generation feature for properties
                        based on multiple attributes. I optimized the process to generate real-time descriptions from
                        millions of combinations in under 10 milliseconds, introducing me to <strong>Apache
                            Velocity</strong>. Later, I took ownership of the SEO service, handling ~10 million daily
                        traffic, and optimized it with technologies like <strong>Caffeine Cache</strong> and
                        <strong>Redis</strong>. I upgraded the service from <strong>Java 8 to Java 17</strong> and
                        switched to <strong>OpenJ9</strong> from HotSpot VM, reducing memory footprint by <strong>~50%</strong> and
                        latency by <strong>~15%</strong>. In addition, I designed the system for FAQs and dynamic metadata generation
                        from scratch, exposing me to the intricacies of system design and expanding my knowledge of both
                        relational and NoSQL databases, including <strong>MongoDB</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong>.

                    <span>Optum (UHG), Aug 2020 - Mar 2022</span>
                    <p>
                        I thrived in an <strong>Agile-driven development environment</strong>, where I contributed
                        significantly to various projects. I excelled in developing <strong>RESTful APIs</strong> using
                        <strong>Spring Boot</strong> and crafting responsive front-end applications with
                        <strong>Angular</strong>. My commitment to excellence shone through as I efficiently handled
                        high-priority defects, delivering timely fixes. Additionally, I designed and implemented a
                        <strong>reusable Angular widget from scratch</strong>, which found utility across multiple
                        applications. Notably, I achieved an impressive <strong>97 percent code coverage</strong>
                        through rigorous testing with <strong>Jasmine and Karma</strong>. My innovative thinking came to
                        the fore when I proposed migrating application configurations from a <strong>relational database
                            to AEM</strong>, and successfully executed the migration of reference data, resulting in a
                        <strong>20 percent reduction in app initialization time</strong> and enhanced efficiency.

                    <p>My four-year experience at Chandigarh University, where I studied Computer Science from 2016 to
                        2020, was transformative. I focused on core subjects like <strong>Java</strong>,
                        <strong>RDBMS</strong>, <strong>Data Structures and
                            Algorithms</strong>, and applied this knowledge to intriguing <storng>IoT</storng> projects
